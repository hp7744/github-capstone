However, this traditional venue to gather infomraiton are subject to misleading infomration due to seleciton bias etc. The problme can be perfectly solved as technology involves, now that data science comes in to play. We can simply let the businesses owner know if a neighborhood is ideal for their location decision using quantitative approach. Thus, increase their possibility of sucess and reduce the chances of failure due to lack of professional analysis. The Business Problem/recommendation I will be investigating is that when business owners planning to open up new locations, weather one location is better than others. The following analysis will be using three measures to evaluate between various lcoations, including income, population and the competitors. The busines owners will be particularly care about this problem and have the needs for integrated locaitonal anlaysis becuasing location decision is the most fundamental part of business planning in most small businesses like restaruants or small shps, and this is directly correlated with their sucess.",

The study takes into account the population, location choices of competitors as well as the average income. This will reflect the level of living standard in a neighboorhoods, level of competition. However, there are more factors that will affect my business problme that weather choosing one location over another will increase the possibility of success. For example, the product positioning may be very welcomed by some neighborhoods over other onces. In conclusion, further studies is recommended for the more accurate results.",
